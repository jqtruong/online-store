* Schema

** [2018-02-11 Sun]
   discounts are applied on items during checkout, or
   completing the order. 
   
   if x-quantity in bxgo includes previous orders, read
   customer's history and add one to the order if qualified,
   else check order for quantity.
   
   In a web application, a Order class will calculate the
   actual cost based on the Items being purchased and any
   applicable Discounts.
